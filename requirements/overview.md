# Echo - Project Overview

## Vision
Make high-quality, anonymous peer feedback as easy as a 15-minute audio chat, and turn it into an actionable growth plan for every knowledge worker.

## Problem Statement
Current peer feedback processes are broken:
- **Manual forms** create friction and survey fatigue
- **Chasing colleagues** delays feedback collection
- **Vague comments** provide little actionable insight
- **Fear of retaliation** prevents honest feedback
- **Time-consuming processes** reduce participation rates

## Solution
Echo transforms peer feedback through:
- **15-minute AI-conducted audio interviews** for natural conversation
- **Anonymous processing** with differential privacy protection
- **AI-generated insights** that create actionable growth plans
- **Automated workflow** from invitation to final report

## Key Business Metrics
| Metric | 6-Month Target | Purpose |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Sessions created/month | 1,000 | Core engagement driver |
| Invitee completion rate | ≥70% | Ensures data validity |
| Active requester retention | ≥50% repeat within 35 days | Habit formation |
| Net Promoter Score | ≥45 | Product-market fit indicator |

## Core User Journey
1. **Session Creation**: Wizard captures focus topics, custom questions, and 3-10 invitees
2. **AI Question Generation**: ScopeScout adds questions to reach exactly 5 total
3. **Automated Invitations**: Email with unique audio interview links
4. **Audio Interviews**: 15-minute AI-conducted conversations with waveform visuals
5. **Privacy Processing**: Differential privacy paraphrasing removes identifiers
6. **Report Generation**: ClarityCore creates anonymous insights with SMART actions
7. **Delivery**: Dashboard access with PDF export and auto-scheduled follow-up

## Success Criteria
- **User Adoption**: 1,000 monthly sessions within 6 months
- **Completion Quality**: 70%+ invitee participation rate
- **User Satisfaction**: NPS ≥45 indicating strong product-market fit
- **Retention**: 50%+ of users create second session within 35 days

## Constraints & Assumptions
- **Privacy First**: All PII encrypted, audio discarded after transcription
- **Time Bounded**: 15-minute interview maximum to ensure participation
- **Anonymous**: Minimum 3 invitees required for differential privacy
- **Web-Only**: PWA deployment, no native apps in v1.0
