## 2025-07-13 - Project Initialization

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive project documentation structure
- Built requirements folder with PRD, overview.md, user-stories.md
- Created design folder with tech-stack.md and architecture.md
- Set up development files: CLAUDE.md, README.md, .env.example, .gitignore
- Initialized package.json with complete dependency list
- Created Incremental To-Do List with 96 tasks across 10 phases

### Decisions Made üí°
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 + Supabase + LiveKit + OpenAI GPT-4o
- **Project Structure**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation approach
- **Development Process**: Incremental development with clear phase gates
- **Documentation**: Single DEVELOPMENT.md file for chronological tracking
- **Privacy Approach**: Differential privacy with epsilon=1 for transcript anonymization

### Project Stats üìä
- **Total Tasks**: 96 tasks across 10 phases
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks (Jul 25 - Oct 17)
- **Team Size**: 2.5 people (2 engineers, 0.5 designer)
- **Critical Path**: Foundation ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Sessions ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Audio ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Reports

### Next Session üîÑ
- **Priority**: Start Phase 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure
- **First Tasks**: [1.1] Initialize Next.js project, [1.2] Configure Tailwind CSS
- **Goal**: Complete critical setup tasks that block other development

## Development Guidelines

### Daily Logging Best Practices
1. **Log at end of each coding session** - Don't wait until end of day
2. **Be specific with task references** - Use Incremental To-Do List IDs
3. **Document decisions immediately** - Context is lost quickly
4. **Note time spent vs estimated** - Improve future planning
5. **Record blockers and solutions** - Help future debugging

### What to Include
- **Code Changes**: Major commits, refactoring, new components
- **Dependencies**: Libraries added/removed with justification
- **API Integrations**: Configuration notes and gotchas
- **Testing**: Test coverage, testing strategies, results
- **Performance**: Optimization efforts and measurements
- **User Experience**: UI/UX decisions and user feedback

### What NOT to Include
- Minor bug fixes (unless they reveal larger issues)
- Routine dependency updates (unless they break something)
- Personal notes unrelated to the project
- Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
